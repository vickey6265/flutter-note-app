A beautifully designed note-taking app built with Flutter. The app includes:
	•	Themed notes with color-coded tags.
	•	Active/Completed filtering with seamless toggling.
	•	Responsive search for quick access to notes.
	•	Intuitive swipe actions for editing and deleting notes.
	•	A splash screen for a polished user experience.
